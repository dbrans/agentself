# agentself

A self-improving coding agent.

## Status

Bootstrapping. Using Claude Code and Gemini CLI to develop the initial agent.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Lint
uv run ruff check .
```

## Philosophy

- Stay simple and nimble
- Prioritize homoiconicity of code, data, prompts, workflows, and knowledge
- The agent can read and write itself
