In this folder we are creating a coding agent that is self-improving. 
Status: Until the agent is bootstrapped, we will use a mix of claude code and gemini-cli to bootstrap the agent.

- use uv for dep management and running python
- stay as simple and nimble as possible
- where it is practical, prioritize homoiconicity of code, data, prompts, workflows and knowledge
