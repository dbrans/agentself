ABSTRACT



We study allowing large language models (LLMs) to process arbitrarily long
prompts through the lens of inference-time scaling. We propose **Recursive Lan-**
**guage Models** ( **RLM** s), a general inference strategy that treats long prompts as
part of an external _environment_ and allows the LLM to _programmatically_ examine,
decompose, and recursively call itself over snippets of the prompt. We find that
RLMs successfully handle inputs up to two orders of magnitude beyond model
context windows and, even for shorter prompts, dramatically outperform the quality of base LLMs and common long-context scaffolds across four diverse longcontext tasks, while having comparable (or cheaper) cost per query.

Figure 1: A comparison of GPT-5 and a corresponding RLM on three long-context tasks of increasing complexity: **S-NIAH**, **OOLONG**, and **OOLONG-Pairs** . For each task, we scale the input
length from 2 [13] to 2 [18] . GPT-5 performance degrades significantly as a function of both input length
and task complexity, while the RLM maintains strong performance. Inputs beyond the red region
do not fit in GPT-5’s context window of 272K tokens, but the RLM handles them effectively. Additional experiments across other models, methods, and benchmarks are in §2.


Despite rapid progress in reasoning and tool use, modern language models still have limited context
lengths and, even within these limits, appear to inevitably exhibit _context rot_ (Hong et al., 2025), the
phenomenon illustrated in the left-hand side of Figure 1 where the quality of even frontier models
like GPT-5 degrades quickly as context gets longer. Though we expect context lengths to steadily
rise through improvements to training, architecture, and infrastructure, we are interested in _whether_
_it possible to dramatically scale the context size of general-purpose LLMs by orders of magnitude_ .
This is increasingly urgent as LLMs begin to be widely adopted for long-horizon tasks, in which
they must routinely process tens if not hundreds of millions of tokens.


We study this question through the lens of scaling inference-time compute. We draw broad inspiration from _out-of-core_ algorithms, in which data-processing systems with a small but fast main
memory can process far larger datasets by cleverly managing how data is fetched into memory.
Inference-time methods for dealing with what are in essence long-context problems are very common, though typically task-specific. One general and increasingly popular inference-time approach
in this space is context condensation or compaction (Khattab et al., 2021; Smith, 2025; OpenAI,
2025; Wu et al., 2025), in which the context is repeatedly summarized once it exceeds a length
threshold. Unfortunately, compaction is rarely expressive enough for tasks that require dense access

Figure 2: A Recursive Language Model (RLM) treats prompts as part of the environment. It loads
the input prompt as a variable inside a Python REPL environment _E_ and writes code to peek into,
decompose, and invoke itself recursively over programmatic snippets of the variable.


to many parts of the prompt, as it presumes in effect that _some_ details that appear early in the prompt
can safely be forgotten to make room for new content.


We introduce **Recursive Language Models** ( **RLM** s), a general-purpose inference paradigm for
dramatically scaling the effective input and output lengths of modern LLMs. The key insight is
that long prompts should not be fed into the neural network (e.g., Transformer) directly but should
instead be treated as _part of the environment that the LLM can symbolically interact with_ .


As Figure 2 illustrates, an RLM exposes the same external interface as an LLM: it accepts a string
prompt of arbitrary structure and produces a string response. Given a prompt _P_, the RLM initializes
a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) programming environment in which _P_ is set as the value of a
variable. It then offers the LLM general context about the REPL environment (e.g., the length of the
string _P_ ), and permits it to write code that peeks into and decomposes _P_, and to iteratively observe
any side effects from execution. Crucially, RLMs encourage the LLM, in the code it produces, to
programmatically construct sub-tasks on which they can invoke themselves recursively.


By treating the prompt as an object in the external environment, this simple design of RLMs tackles
a foundational limitation in the many prior approaches (Anthropic, 2025; Sentient, 2025; Schroeder
et al., 2025; Sun et al., 2025), which focus on recursive decomposition of the _tasks_ but cannot allow
their input to scale beyond the context window of the underlying LLM.


We evaluate RLMs using a frontier closed model (GPT-5; OpenAI 2025) and a frontier open model
(Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B; Team 2025) across four diverse tasks with varying levels of complexity
for deep research (Chen et al., 2025), information aggregation (Bertsch et al., 2025), code repository
understanding (Bai et al., 2025), and a synthetic pairwise reasoning task where even frontier models
fail catastrophically. We compare RLMs against direct LLM calls as well as context compaction,
retrieval tool-use agents, and code-generation agents. We find that RLMs demonstrate extremely
strong performance even at the 10M+ token scale, and dramatically outperform all other approaches
at long-context processing, in most cases by double-digit percentage gains while maintaining a comparable or lower cost. In particular, as demonstrated in Figure 1 exhibit far less severe degradation
for longer contexts and more sophisticated tasks.

2 SCALING LONG CONTEXT TASKS


Recent work (Hsieh et al., 2024; Goldman et al., 2025; Hong et al., 2025) has successfully argued
that the _effective_ context window of LLMs can often be much shorter than a model’s physical maximum number of tokens. Going further, we hypothesize that the effective context window of an LLM
cannot be understood independently of the _specific task_ . That is, more “complex” problems will
exhibit degradation at even _shorter_ lengths than simpler ones. Because of this, we must characterize
tasks in terms of how their complexity _scales with prompt length_ .


For example, needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) problems generally keep ‘needles’ constant as prompt
length is scaled. As a result, while previous generations of models struggled with NIAH tasks,
frontier models can reliably solve these tasks in RULER (Hsieh et al., 2024) even in the 1M+ token
settings. Nonetheless, the same models struggle even at shorter lengths on OOLONG (Bertsch et al.,
2025), which is a task where the answer depends explicitly on almost every line in the prompt. [1]


2.1 TASKS


Grounded in this intuition, we design our empirical evaluation around tasks where we are able to
vary not just the lengths of the prompts, but also consider different scaling patterns for problem
complexity. We loosely characterize each task by _information density_, i.e. how much information
an agent is required to process to answer the task, and how this scales with different input sizes.


**S-NIAH** . Following the single needle-in-the-haystack task in RULER (Hsieh et al., 2024), we consider a set of 50 single needle-in-the-haystack tasks that require finding a specific phrase or number
in a large set of unrelated text. These tasks require finding a single answer regardless of input size,
and as a result scale roughly constant in processing costs with respect to input length.


**BrowseComp-Plus (1K documents)** (Chen et al., 2025). A multi-hop question-answering benchmark for DeepResearch (OpenAI, 2025) questions that requires reasoning over multiple different
documents. The benchmark provides a verified offline corpus of 100K documents that is guaranteed
to contain gold, evidence, and hard negative documents for each task. Following Sun et al. (2025),
we use 150 randomly sampled tasks as our evaluation set; we provide 1000 randomly chosen documents to the model or agent, in which the gold and evidence documents are guaranteed to exist.
We report the percentage of correct answers. The answer to each task requires piecing together information from several documents, making these tasks more complicated than **S-NIAH** despite also
requiring a constant number of documents to answer.


**OOLONG** (Bertsch et al., 2025). A long reasoning benchmark that requires examining and transforming chunks of the input semantically, then aggregating these chunks to form a final answer.
We report scoring based on the original paper, which scores numerical answers as score(ˆ _y_ ) =
0 _._ 75 _[|][y][−][y]_ [ˆ] _[|]_ and other answers as exact match. We focus specifically on the trec ~~c~~ oarse split,
which is a set of 50 tasks over a dataset of questions with semantic labels. Each task requires using
nearly all entries of the dataset, and therefore scales linearly in processing costs relative to the input
length.


**OOLONG-Pairs** . We manually modify the trec ~~c~~ oarse split of OOLONG to include 20 new
queries that specifically require aggregating _pairs_ of chunks to construct the final answer. In Appendix E.1, we explicitly provide all queries in this benchmark. We report F1 scores over the answer.
Each task requires using nearly all _pairs_ of entries of the dataset, and therefore scales quadratically
in processing costs relative to the input length.


**LongBench-v2 CodeQA** (Bai et al., 2025). A multi-choice code repository understanding split from
LongBench-v2 that is challenging for modern frontier models. We report the score as the percentage
of correct answers. Each task requires reasoning over a fixed number of files in a codebase to find
the right answer.


1This intuition helps explain the patterns seen in Figure 1 earlier: GPT-5 scales effectively on the S-NIAH
task, where the needle size is constant despite longer prompts, but shows faster degradation at increasingly
_shorter_ context lengths on the _linear_ complexity OOLONG and the _quadratic_ complexity OOLONG-Pairs.

2.2 METHODS AND BASELINES


We compare RLMs against other commonly used task-agnostic methods. For each of the following methods, we use two contemporary LMs, GPT-5 with medium reasoning (OpenAI, 2025) and
default sampling parameters and Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B (Yang et al., 2025) using the sampling
parameters described in Team (2025), chosen to provide results for a commercial and open frontier
model respectively. For Qwen3-Coder, we compute costs based on the Fireworks provider (Fireworks, 2025). In addition to evaluating the base model on all tasks, we also evaluate the following
methods and baselines:


**RLM with REPL** . We implement an RLM that loads its context as a string in the memory of a
Python REPL environment. The REPL environment also loads in a module that allows it to query
a sub-LM inside the environment. The system prompt is fixed across all experiments (see Appendix D). For the GPT-5 experiments, we use GPT-5-mini for the recursive LMs and GPT-5 for the
root LM, as we found this choice to strike a powerful tradeoff between the capabilities of RLMs and
the cost of the recursive calls.


**RLM with REPL, no sub-calls** . We provide an ablation of our method. In it, the REPL environment
loads in the context, but is not able to use sub-LM calls. In this setting, the LM can still interact with
its context in a REPL environment before providing a final answer.


**Summary agent.** Following Sun et al. (2025); Wu et al. (2025); Yu et al. (2025), we consider an
iterative agent that invokes a summary of the context as it is filled. For example, given a corpus
of documents, it will iteratively view the documents and summarize when full. In cases where the
provided context exceeds the model window, the agent will chunks the input to fit within the model
context window and invoke the same strategy over these chunks. For GPT-5, due to the extremely
high cost of handling large token inputs, we use GPT-5-nano for compaction and GPT-5 to provide
the final answer.


**CodeAct (+ BM25).** We compare directly to a CodeAct (Wang et al., 2024) agent that can execute
code inside of a ReAct (Yao et al., 2023) loop. Unlike an RLM, it does not offload its prompt to
the code environment, and instead provides it directly to the LM. Furthermore, following Jimenez
et al. (2024); Chen et al. (2025), we equip this agent with a BM25 (Robertson & Zaragoza, 2009)
retriever that indexes the input context for tasks where this is appropriate.


3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION


We focus our main experiments in Table 1 on the benchmarks described in §2.1. Furthermore, we
explore how frontier model and RLM performance degrades as input contexts grow in Figure 1.

**Observation 1: RLMs can scale to the 10M+ token regime and can outperform base LMs and**
**existing task-agnostic agent scaffolds on long context tasks** . Across all tasks, RLMs demonstrate
strong performance on input tasks well beyond the effective context window of a frontier LM, outperforming base models and common long-context scaffolds by up to 2 _×_ the performance while
maintaining comparable or cheaper average token costs. Notably, RLMs scale well to the theoretical costs of extending a base model’s context window – on BrowseComp-Plus (1K), the cost of
GPT-5-mini ingesting 6-11M input tokens is $1 _._ 50 _−_ $2 _._ 75, while RLM(GPT-5) has an average cost
of $0 _._ 99 and outperforms both the summarization and retrieval baselines by over 29%.


Furthermore, on tasks where processing costs scale with the input context, RLMs make significant
improvements over the base model on tasks that fit well within the model’s context window. On
OOLONG, the RLM with GPT-5 and Qwen3-Coder outperform the base model by 28 _._ 4% and 33 _._ 3%
respectively. On OOLONG-Pairs, both GPT-5 and Qwen3-Coder make little progress with F1 scores
of _<_ 0 _._ 1%, while the RLM using these models achieve F1 scores of 58 _._ 00% and 23 _._ 11% respectively,
highlighting the emergent capability of RLMs to handle extremely information-dense tasks.


**Observation 2: The REPL environment is necessary for handling long inputs, while the re-**
**cursive sub-calling of RLMs provides strong benefits on information-dense inputs.** A key characteristic of RLMs is offloading the context as a variable in an environment _E_ that the model can
interact with. Even without sub-calling capabilities, our ablation of the RLM is able to scale beyond
the context limit of the model, and outperform the base model and other task-agnostic baselines
on most long context settings. On the CodeQA and BrowseComp+ tasks with Qwen3-Coder, this
ablation is able to outperform the RLM by 17 _._ 9% and 3% respectively.


On information-dense tasks like OOLONG or OOLONG-Pairs, we observed several cases where
recursive LM sub-calling is necessary. In §3.1, we see RLM(Qwen3-Coder) perform the necessary
semantic transformation line-by-line through recursive sub-calls, while the ablation without subcalls is forced to use keyword heuristics to solve these tasks. Across all information-dense tasks,
RLMs outperform the ablation without sub-calling by 10%-59%.


Figure 3: Cost of RLM and baselines described in §2.2 plotted at the 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th
percentile of total API cost. We observe comparable or even lower costs for RLMs at the 50th
percentile, but sharp increases at the tail end due to potentially long RLM trajectories.


**Observation 3: LM performance degrades as a function of input length and problem complex-**
**ity, while RLM performance scales better.** The benchmarks S-NIAH, OOLONG, and OOLONGPairs contain a fixed number of tasks over a context with lengths ranging from 2 [13] to 2 [18] . Furthermore, each benchmark can be loosely categorized by different processing costs of the input context
with respect to length (roughly constant, linear, and quadratic respectively). In Figure 1, we directly
compare an RLM using GPT-5 to base GPT-5 on each task – we find that GPT-5 performance degrades significantly faster for more complex tasks, while RLM performance degrades but at a much
slower rate, which aligns with the findings of Goldman et al. (2025). For context lengths beyond
2 [14], the RLM consistently outperforms GPT-5.


Furthermore, RLM costs scale proportionally to the the complexity of the task, while still remaining
in the same order of magnitude of cost as GPT-5 (see Figure 9 in Appendix C). In §3.1, we explore
what choices the RLM makes in these settings that causes these differences in cost. Lastly, in this
setting, we also observe that the base LM outperforms RLM in the small input context regime. By
construction, an RLM has strictly more representation capacity than an LM: the choice of an environment that calls the root LM is equivalent to the base LM; in practice, however, we observe that


5



![](docs/specs/2026-01-25 Research/images/Arxiv-MIT-RLMs-Paper.pdf-4-0.png)
RLM performance is slightly worse on smaller input lengths, suggesting a tradeoff point between
when to use a base LM and when to use an RLM.


**Observation 4: The inference cost of RLMs remain comparable to a base model call but are**
**high variance due to differences in trajectory lengths.** RLMs iteratively interact with their context
until they find a suitable answer, leading to large differences in iteration length depending on task
complexity. In Figure 3, we plot the quartile costs for each method across all experiments in Table 1
excluding BrowseComp-Plus (1K), as the base models cannot fit any of these tasks in context. For
GPT-5, the median RLM run is cheaper than the median base model run, but many outlier RLM runs
are significantly more expensive than any base model query. However, compared to the summarization baseline which ingests the entire input context, RLMs are up to 3 _×_ cheaper while maintaining
stronger performance across all tasks because the model is able to selectively view context.


We additionally report runtime numbers of each method in Figures 5, 6 in Appendix C, but we note
several important caveats. Unlike API costs, these numbers are heavily dependent on implementation details such as the machine used, API request latency, and the asynchrony of LM calls. In our
implementation of the baselines and RLMs, all LM calls are blocking / sequential. Nevertheless,
similar to costs, we observe a wide range of runtimes, especially for RLMs.


**Observation 5: RLMs are a model-agnostic inference strategy, but different models exhibit**
**different overall decisions on context management and sub-calling.** While GPT-5 and Qwen3Coder-480B both exhibit strong performance as RLMs relative to their base model and other baselines, they also exhibit different performance and behavior across all tasks. On BrowseComp-Plus in
particular, RLM(GPT-5) nearly solves all tasks while RLM(Qwen3-Coder) struggles to solve half.


We note that the RLM system prompt is fixed for each model across all experiments and is not
tuned for any particular benchmark. Between GPT-5 and Qwen3-Coder, the only difference in the
prompt is an extra line in the RLM(Qwen3-Coder) prompt warning against using too many subcalls (see Appendix D). We provide an explicit example of this difference in example B.3, where
RLM(Qwen3-Coder) performs the semantic transformation in OOLONG as a separate sub-LM call
per line while GPT-5 is conservative about sub-querying LMs.


3.1 EMERGENT PATTERNS IN RLM TRAJECTORIES


Even without explicit training, RLMs exhibit interesting context management and problem decomposition behavior. We select several examples of snippets from RLM trajectories to understand how
they solve long context problems and where they can improve. We discuss particular examples of
interesting behavior here, with additional examples in Appendix B.


**Filtering input information using code execution based on model priors.** A key intuition for why
the RLM abstraction can maintain strong performance on huge inputs without exploding costs is the
LM’s ability to filter input context without explicitly seeing it. Furthermore, model priors enable the
RLM to narrow the search space and process fewer input tokens. As an example, in Figure 4a, we
observed RLM(GPT-5) using regex queries search for chunks containing keywords in the original
prompt (e.g. “festival”) and phrases it has a prior about (e.g. “La Union”). Across most trajectories,
a common strategy we observed was probing the context by printing a few lines back to the root
LM, then filtering based on its observations.


**Chunking and recursively sub-calling LMs.** RLMs defer essentially unbounded-length reasoning chains to sub-(R)LM calls. The choice of decomposition can greatly affect task performance,
especially for information-dense problems. In our experiments, we did not observe complicated
partitioning strategies beyond uniform chunking or keyword searches. In Figure 4b, RLM(Qwen3Coder) chunks by newline in a 1000+ line context from OOLONG.


**Answer verification through sub-LM calls with small contexts.** We observed several instances
of answer verification made by RLMs through sub-LM calls. Some of these strategies implicitly
avoid context rot by using sub-LMs to perform verification (see example B.1), while others solely
use code execution to programmatically verify answers are correct. In some instances, however, the
answer verification is redundant and significantly increases the cost per task — in example B.3, we
observed a trajectory on OOLONG where the model tries to reproduce its correct answer more than
five times before choosing the incorrect answer in the end.

Figure 4: RLMs have common patterns in their trajectories when solving tasks. (a) We frequently
observed RLMs filtering and interacting with their context through code like regex queries. (b)
We found that RLMs can effectively decompose their context through recursive sub-calls (c) On
long-output tasks, RLMs are able to solve sub-problems using recursive sub-LM calls and stitch
their outputs to form a final output.


**Passing recursive LM outputs through variables for long output tasks.** RLMs are able to produce essentially unbounded tokens well beyond the limit of the base LM by returning variables in
the REPL as output. Through the REPL, the RLM can iteratively construct these variables as a
mixture of programmatic and sub-(R)LM output calls. We observed this strategy used heavily in
OOLONG-Pairs trajectories, where the RLM stored the output of sub-LM calls over the input in
variables and stitched them together to form a final answer (see Figure 4c).


4 RELATED WORKS


**Long Context LM Systems.** There have primarily been two orthogonal directions for long context
management in language model systems: 1) directly changing the architecture of and retraining the
base LM to handle longer contexts (Press et al., 2022; Gu et al., 2022; Munkhdalai et al., 2024),
and 2) building a scaffold around the LM that implicitly handles the context – RLMs focus on the
latter. One popular class of such strategies is _lossy_ context management, which uses summarization
or truncation to compress the input context at the cost of potentially losing fine-grained information.
For example, MemWalker (Chen et al., 2023) constructs a tree-like data structure of the input that the
LM can navigate when answering long context questions. ReSum (Wu et al., 2025) is another work
that adds a summarization tool to periodically compress the context of a multi-turn agent. Another
class of strategies implement an explicit memory hierarchy in the agent scaffold (Packer et al., 2024;
Chhikara et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025). RLMs are different from prior work in that all context
window management is implicitly handled by the LM itself.


**Task Decomposition through sub-LM calls.** Many LM-based agents (Guo et al., 2024; Anthropic,
2025) use multiple, well-placed LM calls to solve a problem, however many of these calls are
placed based on human-engineered workflows. Several methods like ViperGPT Sur´ıs et al. (2023),
THREAD (Schroeder et al., 2025), DisCIPL (Grand et al., 2025), ReDel Zhu et al. (2024), Context


7


Folding (Sun et al., 2025), and AgentFold (Ye et al., 2025) have explored deferring the choice of
sub-LM calls to the LM. These techniques emphasize _task_ decomposition through recursive LM
calls, but are unable to handle long context inputs beyond the length of the base LM. RLMs, on
the other hand, are enabled by an extremely simple intuition (i.e., placing the prompt as part of the
external environment) to _symbolically_ manipulate arbitrarily long strings and to iteratively refine
their recursion via execution feedback from the persistent REPL environment.


5 LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK


While RLMs show strong performance on tasks beyond the context window limitations of existing
LMs at reasonable inference costs, the optimal mechanism for implementing RLMs remains underexplored. We focused on synchronous sub-calls inside of a Python REPL environment, but we note
that alternative strategies involving asynchronous sub-calls and sandboxed REPLs can potentially
significantly reduce the runtime and inference cost of RLMs. Furthermore, we chose to use a max
recursion depth of one (i.e. sub-calls are LMs); while we found strong performance on existing
long-context benchmarks, we believe that future work should investigate deeper layers of recursion.


Lastly, we focused our experiments on evaluating RLMs using _existing_ frontier models. Explicitly
training models to be used as RLMs (e.g. as root or sub-LMs) could provide additional performance improvements – as we found in §3.1, current models are inefficient decision makers over
their context. We hypothesize that RLM trajectories can be viewed as a form of reasoning (OpenAI et al., 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025), which can be trained by bootstrapping existing frontier
models (Zelikman et al., 2022; 2024).


6 CONCLUSION


We introduced Recursive Language Models (RLMs), a general inference framework for language
models that offloads the input context and enables language models to recursively sub-query language models before providing an output. We explored an instantiation of this framework that
offloads the context into a Python REPL environment as a variable in memory, enabling the LM
to reason over its context in code and recursive LM calls, rather than purely in token space. Our
results across multiple settings and models demonstrated that RLMs are an effective task-agnostic
paradigm for both long-context problems and general reasoning. We are excited to see future work
that explicitly trains models to reason as RLMs, which could result in another axis of scale for the
next generation of language model systems.

A NEGATIVE RESULTS: THINGS WE TRIED THAT DID NOT WORK.


Drawing inspiration from Redmon & Farhadi (2018), we try to be descriptive about what tricks,
quirks, and other relevant things failed and succeeded in a concise manner. Some observations are
based on longer supplementary experiments, while others are based on small samples of results.


**Using the exact same RLM system prompt across all models can be problematic.** We originally
wrote the RLM system prompt with in context examples for GPT-5, and tried to use the same system
prompt for Qwen3-Coder, but found that it led to different, undesirable behavior in the trajectory.
We had to add a small sentence to the RLM system prompt for Qwen3-Coder to prevent it from
using too many recursive sub-calls.


**Models without sufficient coding capabilities struggle as RLMs.** Our instantiation of RLMs relies
on the ability to reason through and deal with the context in a REPL environment. We found from
small scale experiments that smaller models like Qwen3-8B (Yang et al., 2025) struggled without
sufficient coding abilities.


**Thinking** **models** **without** **sufficient** **output** **tokens** **struggle** **as** **RLMs.** In addition to Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct, we also tried experimenting with
Qwen3-235B-A22B as the RLM. While we found positive results across the board from
the base model (e.g. on OOLONG (Bertsch et al., 2025), performance jumped from 30% to 38%),
the smaller gap compared to the evaluated models in the main experiments (Table 1) are due to
multiple trajectories running out of output tokens while producing outputs due to thinking tokens
exceeding the maximum output token length of an individual LM call.


**RLMs without asynchronous LM calls are slow.** We implemented all sub-LM queries naively as
blocking / sequential calls, which caused our RLM experiments to be slow, especially compared to
just the base model. We are confident that this can be resolved with a robust implementation.


**Depending on the model, distinguishing between a final answer and a thought is brittle for**
**RLMs.** The current strategy for distinguishing between a “next turn” and a final answer for the
RLM is to have it wrap its answer in FINAL() or FINAL ~~V~~ AR() tags. Similar to intuition about
structured outputs degrading performance, we also found the model to make strange decisions (e.g.
it outputs its plan as a final answer). We added minor safeguards, but we also believe this issue
should be avoided altogether in the future when models are trained as RLMs.


B ADDITIONAL RLM TRAJECTORIES


In this section, we provide several example trajectories to highlight characteristics of frontier models
as RLMs. Many of the trajectories are too long to fit in text (we also provide the raw trajectories and
a visualizer in our codebase), so we describe each step and show specific examples when relevant.


A few noticeable properties of these trajectories are that RLMs often make non-optimal choices
despite their strong results in §2. For example, in Example B.2, we observed that the RLM with
Qwen3-Coder carefully constructs its final answer through a mix of recursive sub-calls and code
execution in the first iteration, but then discards this information and continues wasting sub-calls
before not using these stored answers. We also observed distinct differences in model behavior such
as in Example B.3, where we found Qwen3-Coder make hundreds to thousands of recursive subcalls for a single simple task, while GPT-5 makes on the order of ten. While these examples are not
comprehensive, they provide useful qualitative insight into how to improve RLMs.


B.1 RLM(GPT-5) ON BROWSECOMP-PLUS-QUERY 74


The total cost of this trajectory was **$0.079** . In this task, the agent must find the answer to the
following multi-hop query given a corpus of 1000 unique documents ( 8.3M total tokens) that contain
evidence documents and negatives:



![](docs/specs/2026-01-25 Research/images/Arxiv-MIT-RLMs-Paper.pdf-12-0.png)



13


**Step 1.** GPT-5 (as the root LM) first decides to probe at the 1000 document list with regex queries.
It has some priors about these events (as shown from its particular choice of words it looks for), but
it also looks for specific keywords in the prompt like “beauty pagent” and “festival”.


**Step 2.** After running its regex queries, the root LM finds an interesting snippet on the chunk at
index 6, so it launches a recursive LM call over this snippet to look for information relevant to the
original query. The RLM is able to both store this information in a variable answer6, as well as
print this information out for the root LM to see. The sub-LM call finds the answer is likely ‘Maria
Dalmacio‘ and stores this information back in the root LM’s environment.


14

![](docs/specs/2026-01-25 Research/images/Arxiv-MIT-RLMs-Paper.pdf-13-2.png)
![](docs/specs/2026-01-25 Research/images/Arxiv-MIT-RLMs-Paper.pdf-14-0.png)

**Step 3.** After checking the information above, the root LM reasons that it has enough information to
answer the query. The root LM chooses to check its answer again with two additional recursive LM
calls to confirm that its answer aligns with this check. Finally, the root LM returns its final answer
as ‘Maria Dalmacio‘, which is the correct answer.


B.2 RLM(QWEN3-CODER) ON OOLONG-PAIRS-QUERY 3


The total cost of this trajectory was **$1.12** . In this task, the agent must output all pairs of user IDs
satisfying some set of properties given a list of entries ( 32k tokens total). This is both an information
dense long input as well as long output task, making it particularly challenging for current LMs.



![](docs/specs/2026-01-25 Research/images/Arxiv-MIT-RLMs-Paper.pdf-14-1.png)

![](docs/specs/2026-01-25 Research/images/Arxiv-MIT-RLMs-Paper.pdf-14-2.png)



**Step 1.** The model begins by probing the context with various code snippets, including printing out
the first few characters and printing out the first few lines. We noticed in particular that Qwen3Coder-480B-A35B tends to output multiple code blocks in a single step unlike GPT-5, which makes
outputs in a more iterative fashion.


15


![](docs/specs/2026-01-25 Research/images/Arxiv-MIT-RLMs-Paper.pdf-15-0.png)

The model continues probing by splitting the input context by newline characters and checking
roughly what the data format looks like.


From the given format, the model chooses to first semantically classify the data using sub-LM calls
over smaller chunks of the input (to avoid context rot and mistakes in larger contexts) and provides
a sample back to the root LM of what it observed during this process.


16



![](docs/specs/2026-01-25 Research/images/Arxiv-MIT-RLMs-Paper.pdf-15-1.png)
![](docs/specs/2026-01-25 Research/images/Arxiv-MIT-RLMs-Paper.pdf-16-0.png)

Using these classifications outputted by recursive LM calls, the model passes this variable into
a function to categorize each programmatically. From here, the root LM is choosing to answer
the rest of the question programmatically rather than by trying to output all pairs through model
generaetions.


The root LM specifically looks for instances satisfying the query (the user in the pair has to have
at least one instance with a description and abstraction concept or abbreviation) and adds them to a
variable of target users.

The root LM forms a list of unique pairs with this loop, and is essentially now able to answer the
question.


The model has stored these pairs in a variable to be outputted at the end. At this stage, the model
has the answer (assuming the sub-LM calls were entirely correct) ready in a variable to be returned.


**Step 2.** By this point the model has already successfully extracted the answer. Interestingly however, as we observed frequently with Qwen3-Coder, the model will continue to repeatedly verify its
answers. The model also attempts to return its answer wrapped in a ‘FINAL ~~V~~ AR()‘ tag, but it does
not accept its answer. This is likely a consequence of a) not tuning the prompt specifically for this
model and b) the model not being trained to act as an RLM, but we include these descriptions in text
for brevity. At this step, the model checks its pairs.


**Step 3.** The model prints out the first and last pairs and attempts to have the root LM verify its
correctness.


**Step 4.** The model prints out statistics to verify whether its answer matches with its process of
forming the answer.


18



![](docs/specs/2026-01-25 Research/images/Arxiv-MIT-RLMs-Paper.pdf-17-1.png)
**Step 5.** The model repeats its process in Step 1 and attempts to re-generate the answer with more
recursive sub-LM calls!


**Step 6 - 11.** The model repeats its process in Step 1 with slight difference and again attempts to
re-generate the answer with more recursive sub-LM calls! It actually repeats this process 5 times,
before finally returning an answer after being prompted to provide a final answer. However, the
answer it returns is the root LM generating an answer, which actually provides the wrong answer

- in this instance, it never returned the answer it built up in its code environment through sub-LM
calls. This is an example of a case where the RLM failed.


B.3 RLM(QWEN3-CODER) ON OOLONG-QUERY 212


The total cost of this trajectory was **$0.38** . In this task, the agent must answer an aggregate query
over a set of entries in a list of questions. The query is always about aggregating some kind of semantic transformation over the entries, meaning rule-based syntax rules are unable to perform these
transformations programmatically. In this example, the RLM is answering the following question:



![](docs/specs/2026-01-25 Research/images/Arxiv-MIT-RLMs-Paper.pdf-18-0.png)



**Step 1.** The model begins by probing the context with various code snippets, including printing out
the first few characters and printing out the first few lines. Like in the OOLONG-Pairs example, we
noticed that Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B tends to output multiple code blocks in a single step unlike
GPT-5, which makes outputs in a more iterative fashion.


As mentioned previously, Qwen3-Coder differs from GPT-5 in how liberal it is in its use of sub-calls.
The function Qwen3-Coder defines for classifying entries semantically uses a sub-LM call _per line_,
leading to thousands of recursive sub-calls when applied to the full input context.

![](docs/specs/2026-01-25 Research/images/Arxiv-MIT-RLMs-Paper.pdf-19-0.png)

**Step 2.** After defining and testing several functions for running the above classification question
over its input context, the root LM launches a long code execution call to classify and answer the
query.


**Final.** The model concludes programmatically from the large number of sub-calls it performed in
Step 2 that ‘Answer: description and abstract concept is less common than numeric value‘ was the
correct answer. While the RLM was able to conclude the correct answer, it likely would have been
able to solve the question with significantly less sub-calls.

B.4 RLM(GPT-5) ON CODEQA-QUERY 44


The total cost of this trajectory was **$0.27** . In this task, the agent must answer a question that involves
understanding a large codebase. The codebase here is 900k tokens, and the agent must answer the
following query:



![](docs/specs/2026-01-25 Research/images/Arxiv-MIT-RLMs-Paper.pdf-20-0.png)



















**Step 1.** It is not always true that an input context can be solved by partitioning it and recursively
sub-querying models over each partition, but in tasks that are not information dense, this is possible.
In this case, the model chooses to break down the codebase into parts and sub-query LMs to look for
clues. The model then aggregates these clues and provides a final answer as a separate sub-query.

C ADDITIONAL RUNTIME AND COST ANALYSIS OF RLMS


We supplement the cost and runtime analysis of RLMs with additional, fine-grained plots. In Figures 7, 8 we include a histogram for the cost of each method on every task for both GPT-5 and
Qwen3-Coder. We generally observe long-tailed, high-variance trajectories for RLMs in both models.


We additionally include log-scaled runtime plots for each method below. As we remarked in §3.1,
the runtime for these methods can be significantly improved through asynchrony of LM calls and
additional prompting to discourage long sub-LM calls or code.


For the scaling plot in Figure 1, we also provide the average API cost per task.

BrowseComp+ (1K) for all methods described in §2.2. We plot the 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th
percentiles.

D ADDITIONAL METHODS AND BASELINE DETAILS


D.1 PROMPTS FOR EXPERIMENTS


We focus on methods that are entirely task agnostic, so we fix our prompt for each method across all
tasks. For the RLM prompt, the only difference between GPT-5 and Qwen3-Coder is an added line
in the beginning that warns Qwen3-Coder not to use too many sub-LM calls – we found in practice
that without this warning, the model will try to perform a subcall on everything, leading to thousands
of LM subcalls for basic tasks! In this section, we provide the system prompt used for all methods
in §2.1 (other than the base model, which does not include a system prompt).


(1a) The system prompt for **RLM with REPL** for GPT-5:

BrowseComp+ following experiments in the original paper (Chen et al., 2025).:

D.2 SUMMARY AGENT BASELINE


The summarization agent baseline follows the scaffold presented in Sun et al. (2025); Wu et al.
(2025); Yu et al. (2025), which also mimics how contexts are typically compressed in a multi-turn
setting in agents like Claude Code (Anthropic, 2025). In an iterative fashion, the agent is given
inputs until its context is full, at which point it is queried to summarize all relevant information and
continue. If the agent is given a context in a single step that is larger than its model context window,
it chunks up this context and performs the summarization process over these chunks.


For our GPT-5 baseline, we chose to use GPT-5-nano to perform summarization to avoid exploding
costs. This explains the large discrepancy in cost in Table 1 between GPT-5 and Qwen3-Coder
on BrowseComp+, where the summary agent using Qwen3-Coder is nearly 20 _×_ more expensive
on average. On this task in particular, we found on a smaller set of 20 random samples that the
performance between using GPT-5 and GPT-5-nano is comparable.


E ADDITIONAL BENCHMARK DETAILS


We provide additional details about the benchmarks used to evaluate RLMs in §2.


28


E.1 OOLONG-PAIRS BENCHMARK


To create OOLONG-Pairs, we synthetically generate 20 new tasks based on the ground-truth labels
for the OOLONG Bertsch et al. (2025) trec ~~c~~ oarse split for input contexts of length in [1024,
2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]. Similar to OOLONG,
each question requires correctly predicing the semantic mapping for each entry.


**Ensuring** _I ≈_ _O_ ( _N_ [2] ) **on OOLONG-Pairs** . We noticed that many tasks that aggregate over pairs
of entries could actually be solved without looking at the pairs and only looking at each entry in a
linear fashion (e.g. using the principle of inclusion-exclusion in set theory), so we explicitly created
questions that ask for all pairs satisfying some properties.

have at least one instance with a numeric value or location. Each of the questions can be labelled

E.2 SCALING HUGE DOCUMENT CORPUSES IN BROWSECOMP+


In addition to the BrowseComp+ (Chen et al., 2025) results for _k_ = 1000 documents in §3, we
also include a smaller set of results on a subset of 20 tasks from the original 150 to show how
performance degrades as a function of input size. In our original experiments, the base LMs were
unable to handle the input contexts, so we add results to show how they degrade. We include two
new baselines, namely **ReAct w/ GPT-5 + BM25** (a variant of the CodeAct baseline without access
to a code environment) and **GPT-5 + pre-query BM25** (GPT-5 on pre-queried documents).


Figure 10: We plot the performance and API cost per answer of various methods using GPT-5 on 20
random queries in BrowseComp-Plus given increasing numbers of documents in context. Only the
iterative methods (RLM, ReAct) maintain reasonable performance at 100+ documents.


32



![](docs/specs/2026-01-25 Research/images/Arxiv-MIT-RLMs-Paper.pdf-31-0.png)
**RLMs are able to scale well without performance degradation.** RLM(GPT-5) is the only model /
agent able to achieve and maintain perfect performance at the 1000 document scale, with the ablation
(no recursion) able to similarly achieve 90% performance. The base GPT-5 model approaches,
regardless of how they are conditioned, show clear signs of performance dropoff as the number of
documents increase.


**RLM inference cost scales reasonably.** The inference cost of RLMs on this setup scale log-linearly,
and are reasonably bounded compared to other common strategies like ReAct + BM25. If we extrapolate the overall token costs of GPT-5 assuming it has an infinite context window, we observe
that the inference cost of using RLM(GPT-5) is cheaper.
