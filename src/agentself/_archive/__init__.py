"""Archived implementation from v0.1.0.

This code implements the original two-phase execution model with local LLM agent.
It's preserved for reference and potential reuse but is not active in the current

To import archived components:
    from agentself._archive.agent import SandboxedAgent
    from agentself._archive.sandbox import Sandbox
    from agentself._archive.capabilities.self_source import SelfSourceCapability
