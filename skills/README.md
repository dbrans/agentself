# Skills

Each skill lives in its own folder under `skills/` and includes a `SKILL.md` file.
Skill metadata is stored in the YAML frontmatter at the top of `SKILL.md`.

List skills:
```bash
uv run agentself-skills list
```

Show a skill:
```bash
uv run agentself-skills show <name>
```

Tip: use `rg`/`grep` on this folder to search for specific terms.
